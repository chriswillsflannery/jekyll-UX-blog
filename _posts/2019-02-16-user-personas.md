Creating, and later iterating upon, user personas is a critical piece of the UX design/strategy puzzle. (Sidenote - yes, you should
continuously be updating your personas throughout the UX process - I'll touch on this later).
When you find a problem in the world that needs a solution, you must also find the customer who needs
that solution the most. To find them, we need a good User Experience Strategy.

The four parts that make up User Experience Strategy are Business Strategy, Value Innovation, Validated User
Research, and Killer UX Design (As defined by Jaime Levy in her UX manifesto `UX Strategy: How to Devise Innovative
Digital Products That People Want`). When you think you may have a solution to a problem in the world, you are attempting to provide value to users of whatever your product ends up being. You will create an elevator pitch, or `value proposition` to help give clarity to your product's functions. Creating user personas helps to validate this value proposition. In other words, before steamrolling ahead with your Great Idea and blowing a bunch of money on a product which may or may not work, it is imperative to first prove that your solution is one which users will actually want.

"Just because your stakeholders (or you) really want your product, doesn't mean anyone else will" -Jaime Levy, `UX Strategy`

A typical provisional persona will include fields like 'name and image/sketch', 'description', 'behaviors', and 'needs/goals'.
It might look something like this:

Provisional personas are a snapshot of potential customers. They can help stakeholders and other members of the team who are building the product to understand users' needs. However, personas are only user-friendly if they actually reflect real-life users' needs. To validate and iterate on these personas, UX strategists need to go out into the world and find real people who represent the potential customer base. They will typically ask screener questions to find people who match (for example, if building an app for a radio station in NYC, screener questions would be Do you live in NYC and Do you listen to the radio). People who pass the screener questions will then be asked more in-depth questions to get a more accurate understanding of users' specific needs. Based on the results, the provisional personas will then be updated with more accurate information. This information may very well inform the team that there is already a product out there that can accomplish the solution, or that people aren't interested, or to pivot their original idea somehow. In any case, this process will save a lot of dollars and a lot of headaches for the team.

Approaching people IRL to conduct on-the-street interviews can be intimidating. But with a bit of preparation, clear and concise questions, and a firm understanding of the purpose of the process, it will be satisfying and well worth the trouble.
