This past month, I've applied to 2 prominent software development bootcamps in Manhattan. I don't want to say that this was a spur-of-the-moment decision, as technically, I've been preparing for these without really knowing it for the better half of the last year, but it was only recently that I decided to take the plunge and look into "going back to school."

Anyway, on to the technical stuff. Bootcamp A, who we'll call "Bootcamp A", is an in-person, 12 week full stack immersive course which covers the gamut of foundational languages and today's hottest frameworks, but surprisingly, only seemed to require an extremely basic understanding of HTML, Javascript and CSS to pass the first round before the first technical interview. In order to pass, you had to create 3 prompted static webpages (something like a splash page, a blog site and a homepage for a business). There was also a more loose requirement to create a splash page for a personal website - it could include anything you want, you just needed to show a general understanding of basic HTML/CSS and implement some rudimentary Javascript. I opted to create a page with some "About" info that could be triggered by an `onClick` method, and an email input which also displayed a success message using another `onClick` method. I passed with flying colors (HTML, CSS + JS are my background, more or less) and have an interview later this week where my admissions counselor and I will go over the code for these projects and I will do my best to explain the rationale for the choices I made.

Bootcamp B is one of the most, if not The Most, highly regarded software development immersive programs in the region, and possibly in the nation. It is also a 12 week full stack course, but right off the bat they tell anyone thinking about applying that the admissions process is extraordinarily rigorous; they only admit something like 5% of applicants. They recommend that those who are admitted to the program dedicate between 90 - 100 hours per week to their studies. In order to pass the first round of admissions, you need to learn basic Ruby, including math, loops, arrays, methods, syntax, and some other introductory stuff like setting up an Integrated Development Environment. After studying, you are given a coding test with an hour on the timer, and asked to code your way through several basic problems.

These might look something like this:
```
Given a string, return a new string which includes only the characters which are not vowels at odd-numbered indices.
```
You are provided with a coding environment, in which you can run and test your code to debug it, and then submit it once you've successfully solved the problem in the prompt. I passed my test, and was thereafter required to schedule my first technical interview. Before the technical interview, you are required to study more basic Ruby, including array methods, enumerables, and more. During this period, you are also allowed to enroll in a free prep course offered in-person to help get the ball rolling, and increase your likelihood of being admitted to the program.



Some thoughts after reflecting on the first steps of the application process for these 2 programs:

1. It's interesting (and perhaps a bit confusing) that one camp starts you right off the bat with front-end processes and the other starts with back-end.

2. As someone who knows Javascript syntax fairly well, Ruby is a breeze to learn, comparatively. I'm actually now a bit resentful that nobody told me to learn Ruby first!!
