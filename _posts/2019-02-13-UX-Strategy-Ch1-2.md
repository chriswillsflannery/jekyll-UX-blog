Jaime Levy's 2015 book `UX Strategy: How to Devise Innovative Digital Products That People Want`
takes a deep dive into what on earth "UX Strategy" actually is.

Every day on Reddit, LinkedIn, and Twitter I and other creatives are absolutely blitzed with UX content. Execs sharing motivational graphics, managers telling inspiring hire stories, experts breaking down information architecture guidelines, etc etc ad infinitum. The problem, though, is that there's so much hype around the field of UX, **so** many new companies, and **so** many new hires that everyone seems to have a different definition of what UX design is, of what UX strategy is, of what interaction design is. It's hard to parse through all the nonsense and see which posts are genuinely well-meaning/helpful, and which ones are posted for clout/internet/industry points.

Jamie Levy is basically the fairy godmother of UX. She's been doing this stuff since the early 90's, when a lot of people still didn't even have dialup. Her formula is this: `UX Strategy = Business Strategy + Value Innovation + Validated User Research + Killer UX Design`. What the heck do all these things mean?

Business Strategy is the plan that continually makes sure that the business is growing in its market. Growth typically comes from improvements in cost leadership and product differentiation. In the digital world, is it crucial to be constantly updating your business strategy. `There is no North Star in UX` - this is a common way of saying, your goals must be ever-re-aligning based on testing and feedback.

Value Innovation is the process of looking for opportunities in a `Blue-Ocean` market, that is, seeking out a space which is uncontested, and free for the taking. This might not necessarily mean being first to market, but entering into a space with less fish will certainly better your odds.

Validated User Research means almost literally taking a step backwards and making sure that the idea presented is something that users actually want. This would happen through user-testing of something like a `Minimum Viable Product`, a barebones-but-usable version of your product which can provide qualitative feedback. In the book, Levy describes a software engineer who starts a company in a niche where he sees a 'Blue Ocean' opportunity. The company flops because they based their strategy on assumptions about users rather than actually having real, qualitative data from real people.

Killer UX Design is exactly what you think it is. How does the user feel when they're logged into your app? Are they easily able to find what they need on your website? Is the hardware intuitive? AirBnB, Uber, Tinder and Waze are some good examples of apps which provide intuitive value to user, and are presented beautifully.

Boom. UX Strategy. Think of it as the stuff that happens both before, and concurrent with, UX Design. UX Strategy is not just a way of designing, but a way of thinking.
