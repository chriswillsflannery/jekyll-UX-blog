Hello! My name is Chris and I'm a 25-year-old multimedia designer from New Jersey.

While most of my experience comes from a music background, I also work in media, politics, publishing and advertising. I love creating things at the intersection of visual design and software development, and often take on new freelance projects.

If you think we might be a good fit for each other, let's talk about your project and we can pinpoint exactly how I can help you achieve your vision. I look forward to working together!
